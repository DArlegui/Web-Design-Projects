# Web Design Projects

Welcome to my collection of web design projects! This repository showcases a variety of web pages and applications that I've developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each project is designed to demonstrate my skills in creating interactive and visually appealing web experiences.

## Project 1: Shopping List

### [Live Demo Here](https://fascinating-gumption-baa35a.netlify.app/)

This project aims to provide users with a simple and user-friendly interface to create and manage their shopping lists digitally. The application utilizes JavaScript to instantly update the displayed list as users add, remove, filter, or remove items. All their changes are saved locally.

#### Features

- **Add Items:** Quickly add items to your shopping list.
- **Remove Items:** Remove unwanted items with a single click.
- **Filter Items:** Easily find items by searching.
- **Clear All:** Remove all items from the list at once.
